Projec Title: Predicting Parkinson’s: Using Neural Networks to Evaluate the Genetic Risk Factors Behind the Disease

To date, researchers do not know the exact reasons for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta
(SNpc) that leads to Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Thus, it is extremely difficult to predict whether a patient is likely to develop
the disease later on, as their risk increases with age. However, by the time patients present with the common symptoms
indicative of the illness, a substantial amount of dopaminergic neurons are already lost. Seeing as there are no current
avenues of replacing those neurons, predictive diagnosis and preventive measures could be of extraordinary help in devising
treatment plans. Our aim was to use the significant research into possible high-risk genetic factors from genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) to formulate a predictive neural network model that could compute a patient’s risk of developing
Parkinson’s. We analyzed patient genomes for mutations in the top 20 genes associated with PD, as well as 21 genes
implicated in axon guidance pathways, to determine whether the patients were at high or low risk for Parkinson’s. Our model
produced an accuracy and AUROC of 94%. We found this significant because it showed a strong correlation between the
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we analyzed and PD. To further improve our model, one could add considerations
for other investigated risk factors, such as patient age, familial history of disease, prodromal illnesses, or gut microbiota
inconsistencies among others.
